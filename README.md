# sansar-avatarpaint
Sansar scripting demo, "AvatarPaint," which allows avatars to appear painted with a specific color or be randomly colorized on a per-material basis. This effect is triggered by avatar interactions with designated trigger volumes, and avatars can be "cleansed" of the effect in a separate cleansing area.
